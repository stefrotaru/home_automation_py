# Home Automation System (Py)

## Description

This project is part of the 'Computational Thinking' book written by Karl Beecher. I have really enjoyed the book and I wish I would've discover it earlier.

This project in its finished state aims to be a computer-controlled home automation system. The system should control the following parts of the house:
    - Ventilation (regulate moisture content in the air, which should never exceed 70%)
    - Heating (regulate room temperature to be between 18-22 degrees celsius)
    - Lighting (turn on/off room lighting wether the room is occupied or not)
    - Control panel (control for the automation system)

## System structure

The system is divided into two packages:
    - core: the central parts of the home automation system.
    - subsystems: the different subsystems that make up a home automation system.

## Unit tests

`python -m unittest test/<unittest-file.py>` - runs suite of tests
